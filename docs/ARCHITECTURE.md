The **18 MCP tools** map to engine functions:

| Tool | Engine entry point |
|------|-------------------|
| `seam_schema` | `query/schema.py` |
| `seam_architecture` | `query/architecture.py` |
| `seam_snippet` | `query/snippet.py` |
| `seam_graph_search` | `query/graph_search.py` |
| `seam_graph_search` recipes | `query/graph_recipes.py` |
| `seam_suspects` | `query/suspects.py` |
| `seam_query` · `seam_search` · `seam_context` | `query/engine.py` (+ `query/semantic.py` hybrid) |
| `seam_context_pack` | `query/pack.py` |
| `seam_plan` | `query/plan.py` composing `query/pack.py`, `analysis/impact.py`, `analysis/changes.py`, and `analysis/affected.py` |
| `seam_why` | `analysis/comments.py` |
| `seam_clusters` | `query/clusters.py` |
| `seam_structure` | `query/structure.py` |
| `seam_impact` | `analysis/impact.py` → `server/impact_handler.py` |

| `seam_changes` | `analysis/changes.py` |
| `seam_affected` | `analysis/affected.py` |

### Layered import hierarchy

Dependencies flow strictly **downward** — a lower layer never imports an upper one.

```text
   cli/  ·  server/  ·  watcher/  ·  web/      ← entry points & transports
                    │
                    ▼
                analysis/                       ← graph reasoning (impact, trace,
                    │                              changes, affected, clusters,
                    ▼                              synthesis, + pure leaves)
                 query/                          ← read path (engine, pack,
                    │                              semantic, structure, names)
                    ▼
             indexer/  ·  db                     ← write path (parse → extract →
                                                   upsert) + SQLite schema
```

### The leaf discipline

`analysis/` is built from **pure leaf modules** — they import only stdlib + `seam.config`,
touch no database, perform no IO, and **never raise** (they degrade to an empty/neutral
result on any error). This keeps each algorithm unit-testable in isolation and shrinks the
failure surface of the hot read path. Notable leaves:

| Leaf | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| `analysis/clustering.py` | Pure Louvain community detection (graph in → `{name: cluster_id}` out). |
| `analysis/rwr.py` | Personalized PageRank for `context_pack` neighbor ranking. |
| `analysis/relevance.py` | `seam_impact` external-vs-self-ref ordering. |
| `analysis/byte_budget.py` | The `seam_impact` hard byte ceiling (`fit_to_byte_budget`). |
| `analysis/steer.py` | The `next_actions` truncation-hint generator. |
| `analysis/staleness.py` | Index-staleness verdict (single source of truth; CLI + MCP both use it). |
| `analysis/builtins.py` · `imports.py` | Builtin vocabulary + per-language import resolution. |

### The facade split (server layer)

`server/tools.py` is a **thin facade** that re-exports every handler so `server/mcp.py`
and all imports stay byte-identical, while the implementation lives in focused files under
the 1000-line cap: `impact_handler.py` (all `seam_impact` shaping), `trace_handler.py`
(`seam_trace`), and `handler_common.py` (shared serializers, limit constants, the
`_maybe_attach_staleness` banner helper, the stable-`uid` resolver).

### Write path (`seam init`)

```text
1. walk the tree, collect files by SEAM_LANGUAGE_MAP extension
2. per file:  parse → extract symbols + edges + comments + import_mappings → upsert (atomic)
              (FTS5 stays in sync via triggers; field-access/holds/uses edges extracted here)
3. clustering post-pass    (whole graph; excludes synthesized edges)
4. synthesis post-pass     (whole graph; AFTER clustering; gated in sync on graph_changed)
5. [--semantic] embedding post-pass
6. commit; watcher starts
```

### Read path (a graph tool call)

```text
1. server/tools handler validates + clamps inputs (or CLI routes through the same handler)
2. resolve_edge recomputes confidence against the live name-count map (+ import promotion)
3. analysis/traversal BFS walks the kind-agnostic edge graph from the expanded seed set
4. output shaping: risk tiers · relevance order · per-tier cap · lean · byte ceiling · steer
5. _maybe_attach_staleness appends index_status if the index has drifted
6. _finalize normalizes the MCP envelope (raise on error → isError; None → {found:false})
```

`seam_snippet` is the deliberate exception to the graph-traversal read path. It uses the
index only to resolve identity and line ranges, then checks root containment and reads the
live file directly. That split gives agents exact implementation text after discovery results
without inflating every discovery response with source bodies, while still warning when the
indexed range may be stale.

`seam_architecture` is another deliberate exception: it composes a bounded repository
briefing from existing index tables instead of walking a single seed through the graph.
It returns metadata, ranked sections, warnings, truncation, and next-call guidance, then
expects callers to switch to `seam_graph_search`, `seam_context`, `seam_snippet`, or
`seam_impact` for precise follow-up work.

`seam_plan` is a bounded orchestration surface for agent change planning. Target mode
composes `seam_context_pack`, upstream impact, and indexed test-call evidence into a
ranked inspection list plus a pytest command. Diff mode composes `seam_changes` and
`seam_affected` for the current git state. It does not execute tests, read source bodies,
or introduce new graph facts; its job is to turn existing evidence into the next concrete
inspection and verification steps.

Graph-search recipes live beside, not inside, the SQLite query algorithm. They compile
stable intent ids such as `production-hotspots` or `test-evidence` into existing
typed graph-search filters before validation, then return metadata that explains
which defaults were applied and which caller filters overrode the recipe.

`seam_suspects` is the cleanup-review layer above raw graph search. It starts from
static absence signals, then adds blockers, removal risk, caveats, and follow-up calls
so agents do not treat "no inbound edge observed" as "safe to delete."

### Storage (SQLite, schema v15)

| Table | Holds |
|-------|-------|
| `files` | indexed files with hash + mtime + `indexed_at` |
| `symbols` | nodes: kind (incl. `field`, `route`, `config`, and `resource`), name, qualified_name, signature, decorators, visibility, is_exported, cluster_id, entry_score, search_text |
| `edges` | directed relationships: source, target, `kind` (15 kinds), `confidence`, `receiver`, `synthesized_by`, `provenance` |
| `routes` | first-class HTTP route metadata keyed to route symbols: method, path, normalized_path, framework, handler, confidence, provenance |
| `config_keys` | config/env key metadata keyed to config symbols: normalized key, source family, role, redacted value state/category, confidence, provenance |
| `resources` | runtime resource metadata keyed to resource symbols: category, normalized name, source family, confidence, provenance |
| `comments` | WHY / HACK / NOTE / TODO / FIXME markers |
| `clusters` | Louvain communities: id, label, size, naming_source, cohesion |
| `import_mappings` | per-file import bindings (powers read-time import promotion) |
| `embeddings` | optional semantic vectors (model, dim, blob) — populated by `--semantic` only |
| `symbols_fts` | FTS5 virtual table over name + docstring + signature + search_text |

Schema is loaded packaged-first (`seam/_data/schema.sql`, force-included in the wheel) and
auto-migrates additively on `connect()`. See [`database/schema.sql`](database/schema.sql)
for the authoritative DDL.

Index artifacts use a flat `seam-index.tar.gz` format owned by
`seam.indexer.artifact`: `seam.db` is mandatory, vector sidecars are optional, and
`manifest.json` is embedded in the archive. The manifest records the artifact format,
producer, schema version, repository fingerprint, git metadata, and content flags so
automation can inspect compatibility before touching `.seam/`.

Local artifact import is intentionally stricter than the legacy fetch path. The
`seam inspect-index` and `seam import-index` commands require `seam-index.sha256`,
reject unsafe or unexpected archive members, reject unsupported schema/manifest versions,
and refuse repository identity mismatches unless the caller passes
`--allow-repo-mismatch`. Git remote and HEAD are used when available; the path fingerprint
is a fallback for non-git artifacts. Import extracts into a temporary staging directory,
verifies that the staged SQLite database opens, rebases stored file paths to the local
checkout by default, then swaps `.seam/` atomically. Validation, extraction, rebase, and
swap failures preserve the previous index. `seam fetch` reuses manifest inspection when a
checksum is published, but preserves older no-manifest artifacts as checksum-verified
legacy artifacts with `artifact.manifest=null`, and preserves the no-checksum path with
`artifact.verified=false`.

Infra graph extraction is schema-neutral: Docker Compose and Dockerfile evidence reuses
`symbols.kind='resource'`, the `resources` table, and existing `uses`/`configures` edges. The
dedicated extractor persists only declaration-level evidence: service names, image names,
Dockerfile/stage names, static ports, env-file references, named volumes, networks, and config key
names. Dynamic/interpolated values and raw config values are not written to SQLite.

### Cross-repo workspace federation

Cross-repo analysis is implemented as a CLI-first read layer over multiple existing Seam indexes,
not as a merged workspace database. A workspace root owns `.seam/workspace.json`, a small explicit
registry of repo aliases, repo roots, index paths, observed git identity, root fingerprint, and
registration time. Registration is intentionally user-selected: Seam never scans sibling folders
or guesses that nearby repos should be trusted together.

Workspace commands validate each registered repo before querying it:

- `ready` / `stale` repos can be queried with read-only SQLite connections.
- `missing_index`, `unreadable_index`, `schema_too_new`, `path_moved`, and `identity_changed`
  repos are skipped with structured warnings.

The federation layer qualifies every symbol result at the workspace boundary. Single-repo UIDs
remain unchanged inside each index; workspace results expose `local_uid` plus a repo-qualified
`uid` formatted as `repo_alias:local_uid`. Snippet follow-ups split that workspace UID back into
the target repo alias and local UID, then delegate to the normal single-repo snippet resolver.

The first shipped surfaces are:

- `seam workspace init/add/list/remove/status` for explicit registry lifecycle.
- `seam workspace graph-search` for flattened, repo-qualified graph search.
- `seam workspace snippet` for exact source retrieval from one registered repo.
- `seam workspace route-callers` for route-to-HTTP-call evidence across repos.
- `seam workspace matches` for no-secret config/resource evidence across repos.
- `seam workspace impact` for per-repo local impact with an explicit `cross_repo_evidence`
  channel kept separate from local impact.

Default single-repo commands, the MCP tools, and the Explorer stay single-repo unless a future RFC
adds a distinct permission and UI model. This keeps cross-repo mutation out of MCP and avoids
silently changing existing impact semantics.

## Component Responsibilities

### Indexer Pipeline
**Files:** `seam/indexer/parser.py`, `seam/indexer/graph.py`, `seam/indexer/db.py`

The write path. Triggered by `seam init` (full) or the file watcher (incremental).

1. **parser.py** — Parses source files with tree-sitter. Returns tree-sitter Nodes. Language-specific but implementation-agnostic.
2. **graph.py** — Extracts structured data from AST Nodes. Produces `Symbol` and `Edge` dicts with confidence tags. Pure functions.
3. **db.py** — Writes to SQLite in an atomic transaction. Handles schema init, upsert, delete, and v1→v2 migration (adds `edges.confidence`).

### SQLite Database
**File:** `.seam/seam.db` (per project)

Main tables + FTS5 virtual table (schema v6):
- `files` — indexed files with hash + mtime
- `symbols` — functions, classes, methods; includes `cluster_id` FK (schema v4) and five Phase 4 enrichment columns: `signature`, `decorators`, `is_exported`, `visibility`, `qualified_name` (schema v5)
- `edges` — directed relationships (`call`, `import`, `tests`, and other typed edges) with `confidence` column (schema v2)
- `comments` — semantic comments: WHY/HACK/NOTE/TODO/FIXME markers (schema v3)
- `clusters` — community detection results: id, label, size, naming_source (schema v4)
- `symbols_fts` — FTS5 virtual table covering `symbols.name + docstring + signature` (signature added in schema v5)
- `import_mappings` — per-file import bindings (`local_name`, `exported_name`, `source_module`, `is_default`, `is_namespace`, `is_wildcard`, `line`); populated by pipeline + watcher per file; NOT backfilled by migration (schema v6)

See `docs/database/schema.sql` for full DDL.

### File Watcher
**File:** `seam/watcher/daemon.py`

Runs as a background thread/process alongside the MCP server. Uses watchdog's `Observer` + a custom `FileSystemEventHandler`. Debounces rapid saves to avoid thrashing (default 500ms). On trigger: re-parses the changed file, diffs symbols, updates DB.

### MCP Server
**Files:** `seam/server/mcp.py`, `seam/server/tools.py`

Stdio transport (no HTTP, no ports). The Python MCP SDK handles protocol framing. Eighteen read-only tools are exposed across search/query, context, risk, planning, cleanup review, structure, schema, snippet, and structural graph-search workflows. Tool handlers in `tools.py` validate inputs and delegate to `query/*` or `analysis/*` modules. Since Phase 4, `seam_context`, `seam_search`, and `seam_query` pass through the five enrichment fields from the engine layer unchanged. Since Phase 5, `seam_impact` and `seam_trace` additionally return `resolved_by` (provenance) and `best_candidate` (proximity pick on AMBIGUOUS entries) on each hop/entry.

### Query Engine
**File:** `seam/query/engine.py`

The read path. Five query families:
- **FTS5 search** — BM25-ranked full-text search across symbol names + docstrings + signature (signature added Phase 4)
- **Concept query** — FTS5 match + 1-hop graph expansion (connected symbols)
- **Context** — Direct lookup by symbol name + join to get callers/callees
- **Structural graph search** — typed predicates over symbol/edge metadata for dead-code
  suspects, fan-in/fan-out hotspots, field access, inheritance, static test evidence,
  and bounded one-hop previews
- **Graph-search recipes** — named intent presets that compile into structural graph-search
  filters while preserving the normalized query and caveats
- **Cleanup suspects** — conservative symbol/file cleanup candidates with blockers,
  removal risk, caveats, and recommended follow-up calls

Since Phase 4, the classic engine functions include the five enrichment fields in their output TypedDicts (`ContextResult`, `SearchResult`, `QueryResult`). Pre-v5 rows carry `null` for those fields — callers treat `null` as "unknown". `ContextResult` also separates static test evidence as `test_callers` and `tested_symbols` so agents can see test relationships without treating them as production callers/callees. `seam_graph_search` is a separate structural discovery module and returns compact metadata plus degree summaries instead of source or broad context.

### Clustering (Phase 2)
**Files:** `seam/analysis/clustering.py`, `seam/analysis/cluster_naming.py`, `seam/indexer/cluster_index.py`, `seam/query/clusters.py`

A post-pass that runs after the full `seam init` indexing loop. Never runs per-file or in the watcher.

- **clustering.py** — pure-Python Louvain greedy modularity maximization. Graph in (nodes + edges) → `{symbol_name: cluster_id}` out. No SQLite, no I/O. Deterministic: nodes sorted, tie-breaking by community label.
- **cluster_naming.py** — produces a human-readable label per cluster. Default ("deterministic"): `dominant_dir/file — highest_degree_symbol`. Opt-in ("llm"): calls an OpenAI-compatible endpoint via stdlib `urllib` only when `SEAM_CLUSTER_NAMING=llm` AND `SEAM_LLM_API_KEY` is set. LLM call is isolated and fail-safe (any error falls back to deterministic).
- **cluster_index.py** — orchestration bridge (indexer layer). Reads symbols + edges from the DB, calls detection + naming, writes `clusters` rows and `symbols.cluster_id` in one transaction. Returns -1 on error (not 0) so the CLI can distinguish "clustering failed" from "zero connected edges."
- **query/clusters.py** — read-only query layer. Exposes `list_clusters`, `cluster_members`, `cluster_peers`. Guards pre-v4 indexes (missing table/column) by returning empty results + one-time warning.

Clusters are keyed on symbol name (not row id), which means cross-file symbols with the same name collapse into one graph node (see ADR-007 — known, accepted limitation).

### Analysis Layer (Phase 1)
**Files:** `seam/analysis/traversal.py`, `seam/analysis/impact.py`, `seam/analysis/flows.py`, `seam/analysis/changes.py`

Read-only graph reasoning on top of the SQLite index. No writes. Import hierarchy:

```
cli / server → analysis → query → indexer / db
```

- **traversal.py** — BFS edge-walk from seed symbols. Aggregates path confidence
  using the weakest-hop rule (AMBIGUOUS < INFERRED < EXTRACTED). Returns `Reached`
  dicts (name, distance, confidence). Batches IN-clauses to stay below SQLite's
  `SQLITE_MAX_VARIABLE_NUMBER` limit.
- **impact.py** — Wraps `traversal.walk()` and buckets results into risk tiers:
  `WILL_BREAK` (d=1), `LIKELY_AFFECTED` (d=2), `MAY_NEED_TESTING` (d≥3).
  Returns `ImpactResult` with `found` flag and per-direction `TierGroup` dicts.
- **flows.py** — BFS path-finding (source → target shortest path) and one-hop
  `callers()` / `callees()` queries. Each hop carries per-edge confidence.
- **changes.py** — Shells out to git to get a unified diff, parses it into
  per-file changed line ranges, maps ranges to symbols, runs `impact()` on each
  changed symbol, and rolls up an overall risk level with AMBIGUOUS attenuation.

## Data Flow: Write Path (seam init)

```
1. CLI: walk directory tree, collect files by SEAM_LANGUAGE_MAP extension
2. For each file:
   a. parser.parse_*(path) → tree-sitter Node
   b. graph.extract_symbols(node, language, path) → [Symbol]
   c. graph.extract_edges(node, language, path, symbols) → [Edge] with confidence tags
      and first-pass extractor provenance where the evidence channel matters
      (for example literal local HTTP client calls)
   d. graph.extract_comments(node, language, path) → [Comment]
   e. db.upsert_file(conn, path, symbols, edges, comments)
3. FTS5 index updated automatically via SQLite triggers
4. Clustering post-pass (whole-graph, after all files indexed):
   a. cluster_index.index_clusters(conn, ...) — reads all symbols + edges
   b. clustering.detect_communities(nodes, edges) → {name: cluster_id}
      — synthesized edges (synthesized_by IS NOT NULL) are EXCLUDED here to avoid
        feedback pollution (synthesis runs AFTER clustering and its edges persist)
   c. cluster_naming.label_cluster(members, ...) → (label, naming_source) per community
   d. writes clusters table + symbols.cluster_id in one transaction
5. Edge-synthesis post-pass (whole-graph, runs AFTER clustering — gated):
   a. synthesis_index.index_synthesis(conn, ...) — reads all symbols + edges
   b. synthesis.py (A2 interface→impl override fan-out) + synthesis_channels.py
      (A1a closure-collection, A1b event-emitter) compute synthesized edges
   c. writes them with kind='call', confidence='INFERRED', synthesized_by=<channel>
      in ONE transaction under a synthetic ':synthesis:' files row (idempotent
      delete-then-insert). Never raises; returns -1 on failure (surfaced as "failed").
   — In `seam init` this always runs; in `seam sync` it is GATED on graph_changed
     (or --force-synthesis), exactly like the cluster recompute. NOT run by the watcher.
   — Master switch SEAM_EDGE_SYNTHESIS (default on); "off" skips this step entirely.
6. Test-edge post-pass (whole-graph, after synthesis):
   a. test_edges.index_test_edges(conn) — reads all test symbols, production symbols,
      and direct static edges
   b. materializes kind='tests' edges for direct call/instantiation evidence,
      name-matched import evidence, and unique test-name proximity
   c. writes provenance into synthesized_by ('test-call', 'test-instantiates',
      'test-import', 'test-name-proximity') and never raises; returns -1 on failure.
   — These edges are static evidence only, not runtime coverage. They are rebuilt by
     `seam init`, by `seam sync` when the graph changed, and by the watcher after a
     file update or delete.
7. seam.db committed, watcher starts
```

## Data Flow: Read Path (MCP tool call)

```
1. Agent: seam_query("rate limiting")
2. server/tools.py: validate input
3. query/engine.query(conn, "rate limiting", limit=10)
   a. FTS5 MATCH against symbols_fts
   b. Collect matching symbol IDs
   c. Expand: also return symbols that import/call any matched symbol
   d. Rank by BM25 score + graph proximity
4. Return: [{symbol, file, line, score, callers_count, callees_count}]
```

## Data Flow: Impact Analysis (seam_impact)

```
1. Agent: seam_impact("upsert_file", direction="upstream", max_depth=3)
2. server/tools.py: validate + clamp depth
3. analysis.impact.impact(conn, "upsert_file", "upstream", 3)
   a. analysis.traversal.walk(conn, ["upsert_file"], "upstream", 3)
      — BFS: follow edges where target_name == "upsert_file"
      — propagate weakest-hop confidence along each path
      — return Reached list (name, distance, confidence)
   b. Bucket Reached by distance into risk tiers (d=1/2/3+)
   c. Batch-lookup file paths for all reached names
4. Return: {found, target, upstream: {WILL_BREAK: [...], LIKELY_AFFECTED: [...], ...}}
```

---

## Constraints

- **No external services at runtime** — zero network calls in the MCP server read path. The opt-in LLM cluster naming (`SEAM_CLUSTER_NAMING=llm`) runs only during `seam init` (a build step, not the server), and falls back to deterministic labels on any error — the server is always 100% local.
- **No new runtime dependencies** — Phase 2 clustering is pure-Python Louvain with stdlib only; zero new packages added.
- **No process per project** — MCP server launched with `cwd` = project root; single binary
- **SQLite file size** — target <50MB for a 100k LOC codebase
- **Startup time** — `seam start` must be ready in <500ms after first `seam init`

---

## Phase 3 — Agent-First Interface

> Phase 3 shipped on branch `feat/phase3-agent-interface`. No schema migration required (v4 stays).
> Three vertical slices: search fix, CLI machine-readability, and the `affected` command/tool.

### Search Fallback Cascade (`seam/query/fts.py` + `seam/query/engine.py`)

**Problem being solved:** before Phase 3, `search()` and `query()` passed raw user text directly into
the FTS5 `MATCH` clause. FTS5 implicitly AND-joins space-separated terms, so a query like
`"parse issues board"` returned zero hits if `"board"` was not an indexed token — even though
`"parse"` matched many symbols. To an agent, zero hits looks like "this code doesn't exist."

**Fix:** a new pure leaf module `seam/query/fts.py` centralises query construction and rescoring.

`build_match_query(text) -> str`
- Strips FTS5 special characters and operator keywords (AND, OR, NOT, NEAR).
- Wraps each surviving token as a quoted prefix: `"token"*`.
- Joins with ` OR ` — one non-matching word cannot zero the query.
- Why OR and not AND: precision is recovered by `rescore()` after the fact; OR maximises
  recall so the agent gets _something_ to work with rather than an empty list.

`rescore(rows, terms) -> list`
- Applies five signals on top of the raw FTS BM25 base score (unbounded heuristic, never rendered as %):
  1. Exact name match: +80
  2. Prefix name match: +40
  3. Path relevance: +10 per query term appearing in the file path
  4. Test-file dampening: -30 when the query has no test-signal words and the result is a test file
  5. Cluster peer boost: +20 when the row shares `cluster_id` with the highest-scoring seed row
     (this signal is unique to Seam — CodeGraph has no cluster concept in its rescore).

`extract_terms(text) -> list[str]`
- Public single source of tokenisation shared by `build_match_query()` and `rescore()`.
  Before Phase 3, `engine.py` had a private duplicate; centralising here prevents drift.

**Fallback cascade in `engine.search()` and `engine.query()`:**

```
FTS5 OR-join MATCH
  → if zero rows: LIKE fallback (case-insensitive substring on symbol name)
    → if zero rows: Damerau-Levenshtein fuzzy scan over distinct symbol names
      (capped at SEAM_FUZZY_MAX_CANDIDATES symbols, max distance SEAM_FUZZY_MAX_DIST=1)
        → if still zero rows: return empty list
```

All three tiers feed `rescore()` before returning, so ranking is consistent regardless of
which tier produced the candidates. A genuinely empty result from all three tiers is still
distinct from `INVALID_QUERY` (bad FTS5 syntax raises `sqlite3.OperationalError` and is
caught and re-raised as the `INVALID_QUERY` error code before the fallback logic runs).

### CLI Output Envelope (`seam/cli/output.py`)

**Problem being solved:** every CLI command emitted Rich/ANSI markup. No `--json`, no `--quiet`,
no stdin support. An agent had to scrape ANSI-decorated output (fragile) or run the full MCP
server (heavy).

**Fix:** `seam/cli/output.py` is a pure leaf module that is the single source of truth for all
structured CLI output.

Explicit: the envelope is defined here, not scattered across commands:
- Success: `{"ok": true, "data": <payload>}`
- Failure: `{"ok": false, "error": {"code": "<STABLE_CODE>", "message": "<human text>"}}`
  + non-zero exit code, written to **stdout** (not stderr).

Why stdout for errors in `--json` mode: agents read stdout. Writing ANSI errors to stderr
(CodeGraph's behaviour) forces agents to multiplex two streams. Seam writes a parseable
envelope to stdout so the agent's stdout parser handles both success and failure paths with
one code path, and the non-zero exit code signals failure to shell pipelines independently.

`--json` and `--quiet` are mutually exclusive. `--quiet` emits bare line-oriented values
(dependent names, test-file paths, the risk level word) for direct piping.

**CLI/MCP parity:** when `--json` or `--quiet` is set, CLI read commands route through the
same `handle_seam_*` handlers that the MCP server uses (`seam/server/tools.py`). This means
the JSON payload inside the `data` envelope is byte-identical to what an MCP tool call would
return — one code path for agents regardless of whether they invoke Seam via MCP or shell.

**Commands with `--json`/`--quiet`:** `impact`, `trace`, `changes`, `why`, `clusters`, `status`, `affected`, `graph-search`, `plan`, `suspects`.
**Commands with `--stdin`:** `affected` (file list), `changes` (file list to narrow changed_symbols/new_files).

Stable error codes (single source in `output.py` docstring):

| Code | Trigger |
|------|---------|
| `NO_INDEX` | Index not found; run `seam init` first |
| `INVALID_INPUT` | Blank/missing required argument, oversized file list |
| `INVALID_QUERY` | Bad FTS5 syntax (rare since Phase 3 sanitization) |
| `NOT_A_GIT_REPO` | `changes` command outside a git repository |
| `DB_ERROR` | Database exists but cannot be opened (corrupted/locked) |

### Affected-Tests Analysis (`seam/analysis/affected.py` + `seam/server/tools.py`)

**Problem being solved:** Seam could tell an agent _what_ symbols were at risk (via `seam_impact`
and `seam_changes`) but not _which tests to run_. That last-mile, action-oriented answer is the
single most useful thing an agent wants before committing.

**New module `seam/analysis/affected.py`:**

`affected(conn, changed_files, *, depth, repo_root) -> AffectedResult`

Algorithm:
1. Resolve each input path to absolute (matching DB storage contract — indexer stores resolved paths).
2. For each changed file:
   - If the file is itself a test file (`is_test_file()`), include it directly.
   - Look up all symbols defined in the file.
   - For each symbol, call `impact(direction="upstream", max_depth=depth)` to find reverse dependents.
   - Collect dependent entries where `is_test=True` → add their files to the affected set.
3. Dedup and stable-sort the test file set (deterministic ordering for agents).

Why reuse `impact(direction="upstream")`: upstream dependents are exactly "who would break if
this changed" — which is also "who calls or imports this." The impact layer already carries
`is_test` per entry, so no duplicate traversal logic is needed (PRD user story 21).

`AffectedResult` TypedDict:
```python
{
  "changed_files":              list[str],  # resolved absolute paths of inputs
  "affected_tests":             list[str],  # sorted unique absolute paths of affected test files
  "total_dependents_traversed": int,        # total entries traversed (informational)
  "partial":                    bool,       # True when SEAM_MAX_AFFECTED_SYMBOLS cap was hit
}
```

`partial=True` means the per-file symbol cap (`SEAM_MAX_AFFECTED_SYMBOLS`, default 50) was hit
for at least one file; the affected set may be incomplete. Raise the cap via env var for
very large files.

**`seam_affected` MCP tool (9th tool, registered in `seam/server/mcp.py`):**

Input: `changed_files: list[str]`, optional `depth: int` (default `SEAM_AFFECTED_DEPTH=5`).
`handle_seam_affected` in `tools.py` clamps the file list to `SEAM_MAX_AFFECTED_FILES` (default 200)
and returns:
```json
{
  "changed_files": ["src/foo.py"],
  "affected_tests": ["tests/unit/test_foo.py"],
  "total_dependents_traversed": 12,
  "partial": false
}
```
All paths are relativized to the project root before returning (consistent with all other handlers).
Empty `changed_files` → `INVALID_INPUT` error. Files not in the index are silently skipped.

**CLI `seam affected` command:**

```bash
seam affected src/foo.py src/bar.py --json
seam affected src/foo.py --quiet               # bare test paths
git diff --name-only | seam affected --stdin --quiet | xargs pytest
```

`--stdin` and positional arguments are mutually exclusive (explicit error if both are supplied).
`--quiet` emits one test-file path per line for direct piping into `pytest` or `xargs`.

### System Diagram Update (Phase 3)

The MCP server section of the system diagram now has a 9th tool:

```
                         ├── seam_affected(files) → analysis.affected()
                                   [Phase 3]
```

And the query engine read path now passes through the FTS fallback cascade before returning:

```
FTS5 OR-MATCH → LIKE fallback → fuzzy scan → rescore() → results
```

---

## Phase 4 — Node-Field Enrichment

> Phase 4 shipped on branch `feat/phase4-node-enrichment`. Schema migrated v4 → v5.
> No new CLI command or MCP tool — three existing tools enriched.

### Extraction Data Flow

```
seam init
  For each source file:
    a. parser.parse_*(path)                        → tree-sitter Node
    b. graph.extract_symbols(node, language, path) → [Symbol]  ← calls extract_node_fields()
       └─ signatures.extract_node_fields(node, language, qualified_name, max_sig_len)
              → NodeFields{signature, decorators, is_exported, visibility, qualified_name}
    c. db.upsert_file() writes the five enrichment columns alongside existing fields
  FTS5 triggers fire on INSERT/UPDATE — 'signature' column now included in symbols_fts
  Read path (MCP call):
    engine.context / search / query → SELECT includes all five columns
    tools.py passes them through to the MCP response unchanged
```

### New Leaf Module: `seam/indexer/signatures.py`

A pure leaf (imports only stdlib + `tree_sitter`; does NOT import any `seam.*` module).
Single public entry point:

```python
extract_node_fields(node, language, qualified_name=None, max_signature_len=300) -> NodeFields
```

Per-language rules (original 5 — `seam/indexer/signatures.py`; Phase 9 additions — `seam/indexer/signatures_ext.py`):
- **Python** — `def name(params) -> return_type` / `class Name(Bases)`; decorators from `decorated_definition` siblings; export = no leading `_`.
- **TypeScript/JavaScript** — `function name(params): return_type` / `class Name<T> extends B`; decorators from prev-sibling walk; export = `export_statement` parent; visibility from access-modifier children.
- **Go** — `func (recv) Name(params) result` / `type Name kind`; export = capitalized first letter; decorators always `[]`.
- **Rust** — `pub fn name(params) -> type` / `pub struct Name`; visibility from `visibility_modifier`; `pub(crate)` → `"crate"`; decorators always `[]`.
- **Java** (Phase 9) — full declaration header; decorators = Java annotations from `modifiers` node (`@Service`, `@Override`); export/visibility from `public`/`private`/`protected` modifier.
- **C#** (Phase 9) — full declaration header; decorators = C# attribute lists (`[Serializable]`); export/visibility from access modifier (`public`/`private`/`protected`/`internal`).
- **Ruby** (Phase 9) — `def name(params)` / `class Name`; decorators always `[]`; visibility = `null` (dynamic DSL); is_exported = `null`.
- **C** (Phase 9) — return type + declarator; decorators always `[]`; `static` storage class → `visibility="private"`, `is_exported=false`; otherwise `is_exported=true`.
- **C++** (Phase 9) — return type + declarator; decorators always `[]`; visibility = `null` (MVP — access specifiers not threaded to individual symbols); is_exported = `null`.
- **PHP** (Phase 9) — full declaration header; decorators = PHP attribute lists (`#[Route(...)]`); export/visibility from `public`/`private`/`protected` modifier.
- **Swift** (Phase 10) — declaration header; decorators = Swift `@attributes` (`@objc`, `@available`); visibility/is_exported from access modifiers (`public`/`open` → exported; `private`/`fileprivate`/`internal` → not exported).

Never raises — any extraction error returns safe defaults (all `null`/`[]`).

### Schema v5 Migration

**`db.py:_run_migration_v4_to_v5()`** — guarded additive migration:
1. `ALTER TABLE symbols ADD COLUMN signature TEXT` (× 5 for all five columns)
2. `DROP TABLE symbols_fts` — existing FTS virtual table lacks the `signature` column
3. Recreate `symbols_fts` with `(name, docstring, signature)` columns
4. `INSERT INTO symbols_fts(symbols_fts) VALUES ('rebuild')` — repopulate from `symbols` table
5. Row-count parity check: aborts and rolls back if FTS row count ≠ symbols row count
6. Bumps `metadata.schema_version` to `'5'`

Wrapped in `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` so concurrent readers are not blocked mid-migration (WAL mode).

**Auto-migrate on connect:** `db.connect()` calls `_apply_pending_migrations()` on every open. Pre-v5 indexes are transparently upgraded on the first `seam start` or `seam_*` call after package upgrade. Callers do not need to re-run `seam init` just to avoid breakage — field values will be `null` until they choose to re-index.

### FTS5 Signature Search

The `symbols_fts` virtual table now indexes three columns: `name`, `docstring`, `signature`.
A type-shaped query like `"conn sqlite3 Connection"` now matches on parameter and return-type
annotations. `fts.rescore()` applies a **+15 signature-match signal** per matched term — smaller
than name-exact (+80) and name-prefix (+40) so signature-only matches rank below name matches.

### Config Knob

`SEAM_MAX_SIGNATURE_LEN` (env var, default `300`) — hard cap on stored signature length.
Signatures longer than this are truncated with `...`. Callers can detect truncation by checking
for a trailing `...`. The default captures the full header of all but pathological multi-annotated
functions; the cap prevents FTS index bloat and unwieldy MCP responses.

---

## Phase 5 — Import Resolution & Confidence Promotion

> Phase 5 shipped on branch `feat/phase5-import-resolution`. Schema migrated v5 → v6.
> No new MCP tool — `seam_impact` and `seam_trace` output gained `resolved_by` + `best_candidate`.

### Why Read-Time

Seam's existing confidence model stores a per-edge `confidence` column written at index time, but
treats that stored value as a non-authoritative hint. The authoritative tier is recomputed against
the live whole-index name-count map on every query (see `seam/analysis/confidence.py`). Phase 5
extends this same model: import mappings are stored at index time, but the promotion decision is
made at read time. This keeps the watcher's per-file re-index correct without back-fill or
write-amplification — after the watcher re-indexes an edited file's import mappings, the next
query resolves against fresh state automatically.

### Resolution Order (`resolve_edge`)

`seam/analysis/confidence.py:resolve_edge()` applies a four-step ordered rule:

```
1. Import promotion (step A):
   If SEAM_IMPORT_RESOLUTION="on" AND a same-file import maps target_name to
   exactly one indexed declaring file → EXTRACTED, resolved_by: import.

2. Name-count rule:
   count == 1 → EXTRACTED, resolved_by: name-unique.
   count >  1 → AMBIGUOUS, resolved_by: name-collision
                + proximity best_candidate (step D, bounded by SEAM_PROXIMITY_MAX_CANDIDATES).

3. Builtin check (fires ONLY at count == 0):
   If SEAM_BUILTIN_FILTERING="on" AND is_builtin(name, language)
   → INFERRED, resolved_by: builtin.
   (Structural guarantee: a user-declared name with count >= 1 can never reach step 3.)

4. Fallback:
   count == 0, not a builtin → INFERRED, resolved_by: unresolved.
```

Step 3's `count==0` guard is load-bearing — it enforces that a user-defined symbol is never
silently treated as a builtin, regardless of what the builtin vocabulary contains.

### New Leaf Modules

**`seam/analysis/imports.py`** — the import-resolution engine. Three public functions:

- `extract_import_mappings(root, filepath, language) -> list[ImportMapping]` — parse a file's
  AST and return all import bindings as typed records. Per-language dispatch covers Python (all
  `import`/`from ... import` forms, relative imports, aliases), TypeScript/JavaScript (named,
  default, namespace, aliased imports), Go (grouped and single `import` declarations), and Rust
  (`use` declarations including scoped lists, wildcards, and aliases). Never raises — returns
  `[]` on any failure.
- `resolve_import_source(source_module, referencing_file, repo_root, language) -> list[str]` —
  map an import source string to existing file paths using per-language extension resolution
  order (Python: `.py`/`/__init__.py`; Rust: `.rs`/`/mod.rs`; TS: `.ts`/`.tsx`/`.d.ts`/`.js`;
  JS: `.js`/`.mjs`/`.cjs`/`/index.js`; Go: package directory). Relative sources resolve from
  the referencing file's directory. Third-party and unresolvable sources return `[]`.
- `compute_path_proximity(referencing_file, candidate_file) -> int` — shared directory segment
  count between two files' parent directories. Pure, no I/O. Used for step D tie-break.

**`seam/analysis/builtins.py`** — curated builtin vocabulary. Single public function:

- `is_builtin(name, language) -> bool` — over static per-language `frozenset`s covering Python,
  TypeScript, JavaScript, Go, and Rust. Conservative scope: well-known builtins/prelude/globals
  only — not an exhaustive stdlib mirror. Language-scoped: a Python builtin name does not
  affect Go or Rust edges.

### `import_mappings` Table (Schema v6)

Populated by `pipeline.py` in the same file-processing pass that writes symbols and edges.
The watcher refreshes mappings per-file using the same delete-then-insert pattern as
`upsert_file` — incremental edits stay fresh without a full re-index.

The table is NOT backfilled by the v5→v6 migration. On an existing index, `connect()` adds the
table (additive, fresh-DB-safe) but rows are empty until `seam init` runs. Until then, every
`resolve_edge()` call silently falls back to the name-count rule (step 2 above), which is
identical to pre-Phase-5 behavior. This mirrors the Phase 4 backfill caveat.

### Schema v6 Migration

`db.py:_run_migration_v5_to_v6()` — additive, guarded:
1. `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS import_mappings (...)` with two indexes (`file_id`, `local_name`).
2. Bumps `metadata.schema_version` to `'6'`.

No column additions to existing tables — purely additive. Fresh DBs are seeded at v6 directly.

### Config Knobs (Phase 5)

| Knob | Default | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `SEAM_IMPORT_RESOLUTION` | `"on"` | Master switch for step A import promotion |
| `SEAM_BUILTIN_FILTERING` | `"on"` | Master switch for step C builtin tagging |
| `SEAM_MAX_IMPORT_CANDIDATES` | `25` | Cap on candidate declaring files per import lookup |
| `SEAM_PROXIMITY_MAX_CANDIDATES` | `25` | Cap on collision candidates for step D proximity ranking |

---

## Phase 6 — Context-Pack Primitive

> Phase 6 shipped on branch `feat/phase6-context-pack`. **No schema change** — pure read-time
> orchestration over existing primitives.

### Why a New Leaf Module Instead of Extending `engine.py`

`seam/query/pack.py` deliberately adds *no* extraction or schema. It composes three existing
read primitives into one bundle so an agent makes a single call instead of chaining
`seam_context` + `seam_why` + a `seam_context` per neighbor. Keeping it in its own module makes
that "orchestration only" boundary explicit and keeps the already-large `engine.py` focused on
the core search/query/context path.

### Bundle Assembly (`context_pack`)

```
context_pack(conn, symbol_name) -> ContextPack | None
  target        ← engine.context(conn, symbol_name)            (verbatim; None ⇒ not found)
  callers/callees ← target["callers"/"callees"] names, ENRICHED via _enrich_neighbors()
  why           ← comments.why(conn, symbol=symbol_name)        (capped)
  cluster_peers ← target["cluster_peers"]                       (no extra query)
  truncated     ← {callers, callees, comments} dropped BY CAPS
  relationship_evidence ← direct edge rows around the target     (bounded)
  caveats/recommended_next_calls ← static-analysis limits + follow-up tools
```

### Neighbor Enrichment (`_enrich_neighbors`)

1. **Deduplicate** the neighbor names (order-preserving).
2. **Batched lookup** in chunks of `_SQLITE_MAX_IN_PARAMS` (900) — one `WHERE name IN (...)`
   per chunk, merged. Chunking exists because SQLite's default host-parameter limit is 999; a
   hot symbol with thousands of distinct neighbors would otherwise raise `OperationalError` and
   silently return an empty list. Each name appears in exactly one chunk, so merging is a dict
   update. `GROUP BY name` + `MIN(s.id)` gives a deterministic first-match-per-name.
3. **Per-file cap** (`SEAM_PACK_PER_FILE_CAP`, default 3) applied first, in lowest-symbol-id
   order, so one file's homonyms cannot flood the bundle (the §4.5a diversity mitigation).
4. **Global cap** (`SEAM_PACK_NEIGHBOR_LIMIT`, default 10 per list) applied to the diverse list.
5. **`truncated`** counts ONLY cap drops — per-file + global. A neighbor name with no symbol row
   (external/unindexed) is skipped and logged at debug, but does NOT inflate `truncated`, because
   a larger cap would never retrieve it (distinct from "the bundle was clipped").

The `decorators` JSON + `is_exported` 0/1/NULL decode is shared with `engine.context()` via the
extracted `engine.decode_enrichment_fields(row)` helper — one decode contract, two callers.

### Direct Relationship Evidence (`pack_evidence`)

`seam/query/pack_evidence.py` reads direct `edges` rows for the target's
`edge_match_names()` and returns two bounded lists:

- `callers`: incoming edges where `target_name` matches the target.
- `callees`: outgoing edges where `source_name` matches the target.

Each record carries `source`, `target`, `direction`, `kind`, `file`, `line`,
`confidence`, `receiver`, `synthesized_by`, and `provenance`. Optional edge columns are
selected as `NULL` when an older index lacks them, so the pack degrades instead of
failing. This helper intentionally does not traverse, infer new edges, or include source
text; it only explains the direct relationships already stored in the index.

`context_pack()` also emits:

- `caveats`: static-analysis, ambiguity, provenance, and truncation warnings.
- `recommended_next_calls`: concrete follow-ups such as `seam_snippet`, `seam_trace`,
  `seam_impact`, or `seam_context`.

### Contract Parity

`context_pack` returns `None` for an unknown symbol — the same contract as `engine.context()`.
Both the MCP tool (`handle_seam_context_pack`) and the CLI (`seam pack`) surface a missing symbol
as a **success** envelope (`{found: false, symbol}`), not an error — mirroring `seam_context`.
No new error code is introduced. Both entry points route through the same handler, so the bundle
is byte-identical between MCP and CLI.

### New Leaf Module + 10th Tool

- `seam/query/pack.py` — `context_pack()`, `ContextPack`/`NeighborRef`/`TruncatedCounts` TypedDicts.
- `seam/query/pack_evidence.py` — bounded direct edge evidence for caller/callee claims.
- `seam_context_pack` registered in `seam/server/mcp.py` — the 10th MCP tool.
- `seam pack <symbol>` CLI command in `seam/cli/main.py` (`--json` / `--quiet`).

### Config Knobs (Phase 6)

| Knob | Default | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `SEAM_PACK_NEIGHBOR_LIMIT` | `10` | Max enriched callers, enriched callees, and direct relationship-evidence rows per direction |
| `SEAM_PACK_PER_FILE_CAP` | `3` | Max neighbor entries from any single file (homonym diversity) |
| `SEAM_PACK_MAX_COMMENTS` | `10` | Max WHY comments included in the bundle |

## Phase 7 — One-Shot `seam sync` with Gated Cluster Recompute

> Phase 7 shipped on branch `feat/phase7-seam-sync`. **No schema change, no migration, no new
> config knobs** — pure orchestration over the existing indexing primitives and the `files` table's
> existing `mtime` + `file_hash` columns.

### Why a New Leaf Module (`seam/indexer/sync.py`)

`seam sync` is the *one-shot* complement to the always-on watcher daemon and the full `seam init`.
The reconcile logic lives in `indexer/sync.py` (not `cli/main.py`) so the import hierarchy stays
`cli → indexer.sync → {indexer.pipeline, indexer.db, indexer.cluster_index}` and the engine is
testable without Typer. It adds **no extraction logic** — it composes `walk_project`,
`index_one_file`, `sha1`, `delete_file`, and `index_clusters`.

### Reconcile Data Flow (`sync`)

```
files table ──┐                       walk_project(root) ──┐
  {path: (mtime, hash)}                  current on-disk set
              │                                            │
              └────────────► per file classify ◄───────────┘
                                   │
   not tracked ──────────────► index_one_file → added   (None → skipped)
   tracked, st_mtime == stored ─► UNCHANGED (no read — cheap pre-filter)
   tracked, mtime differs ─► read + sha1
        hash == stored ─────► UNCHANGED (touch without content change; no re-index)
        hash != stored ─────► index_one_file → modified (None → skipped)
   tracked, absent from walk set AND not exists() ─► delete_file → removed
                                   │
                          graph_changed = (added + modified + removed) > 0
                                   │
   recompute_clusters and (graph_changed or force_clusters) ─► index_clusters (FULL pass)
```

**Why mtime → hash (not git):** filesystem reconcile catches non-git repos *and* committed changes
from pull/checkout/merge/rebase (git bumps mtime, so the cheap pre-filter still fires). The accepted
blind spot — a content change that preserves mtime exactly — is escaped by a full `seam init`.

**Why the `exists()` guard on delete (roadmap §6.1):** trusting the walk set alone to decide
deletions means a transient FS/permission hiccup, a wrong-directory sync, or a `--db-dir` pointed at
another project's index would silently delete *every* tracked file. A tracked path is removed only
once it genuinely no longer exists on disk; a path the walk merely skipped (still present) is kept.

### Why a FULL, Gated Cluster Recompute

Seam's clusters are a **global** Louvain partition over the name-keyed edge graph — one new edge can
re-partition unrelated communities, so there is no correct *incremental* cluster update (this is the
key divergence from CodeGraph, which has no clustering). `seam sync` therefore runs the **same
whole-graph `index_clusters`** that `seam init` runs, but **gated** on `graph_changed or
force_clusters`. A no-op sync skips it entirely — no Louvain cost, no churned cluster IDs.
`--force-clusters` covers the case where the live watcher already indexed edits into `files` (so
sync sees no on-disk drift) but left clusters stale.

`index_clusters` returns its documented `-1` sentinel on failure (it never raises). `sync` preserves
that in `cluster_count` and sets `clusters_recomputed = cluster_count >= 0`, so a failed recompute is
**not** reported as success — the CLI renders it as `clusters: failed` + a warning, mirroring
`seam init`'s `clustering_failed` guard. `cluster_count` is therefore three-valued: `None` (skipped),
`-1` (ran but failed), `≥0` (succeeded).

### CLI-Only, Read-Only MCP Preserved

`seam sync` is a maintenance/write command and joins `init`/`start`/`status` as **CLI-only** — there
is no `seam_sync` MCP tool, so the MCP server read path stays 100% local and read-only (tool count
stays 10). It requires an existing index (`connect()`, not `init_db()`); on a directory with no
`.seam/seam.db` it returns `NO_INDEX`. The `--json` / `--quiet` output flows through the same
`seam/cli/output.py` envelope as the read commands; `--quiet` emits `key: value` lines (one per
field) rather than the read commands' bare single-value form, because the 8-field `SyncResult` would
be ambiguous as bare positional values.

## Phase 8 — Lean Output + `seam_impact` Summary Tier

> Phase 8 shipped on branch `feat/phase8-lean-output`. **No schema change, no migration, no new
> tools** — pure output-shaping at the serialization layer (`seam/server/tools.py`). Motivated by
> the benchmark re-run that showed enrichment had narrowed the token win and that `seam_impact` on
> a hub symbol cost more than reading the files.

### Lever 1 — Lean output (`verbose`)

A single shared helper, `_apply_verbosity(record, verbose)`, is applied at the return edge of every
enrichment-carrying handler (`seam_context`, `seam_trace`, `seam_impact`, `seam_context_pack`),
including the nested records (trace hops, impact tier entries, context_pack neighbors).

- `verbose=True` (default) returns the **same dict object** unchanged — a zero-copy fast path that
  keeps output byte-identical to pre-Phase-8 (the callers build records inline and never mutate
  them, so returning the original is safe).
- `verbose=False` returns a **new dict** without the 6 heavy keys (a single module-level
  `_HEAVY_FIELDS` frozenset is the sole canonical list): `decorators`, `is_exported`, `visibility`,
  `qualified_name`, `resolved_by`, `best_candidate`. `signature` + all core identity fields are kept.

`seam_query` and `seam_search` are **enrichment-free** (their results carry no heavy fields), so they
deliberately have **no** `verbose` flag — advertising a no-op flag would mislead callers. The win
concentrates where records repeat the heavy fields: `seam_trace` ≈ −40%; `seam_context` only ≈ −1–2%
(its heavy fields sit on the single target, not the bare-name caller/callee lists).

### Lever 2 — `seam_impact` summary tier + per-tier cap

`handle_seam_impact` computes `risk_summary` = `{direction: {tier: count}}` from the raw result
**before** capping (so the histogram is trustworthy regardless of `limit`), then slices each tier to
`limit` (default `SEAM_IMPACT_MAX_RESULTS=25`; `limit<=0` = unlimited) and records `truncated` =
`{direction: {tier: omitted}}`. The kept slice is the closest/highest-risk: WILL_BREAK (d=1) and
LIKELY_AFFECTED (d=2) are single-distance tiers, and MAY_NEED_TESTING (d=3..max_depth) arrives in
the analysis layer's BFS (ascending-distance) order, so `entries[:limit]` keeps the closest. The cap
applies **by default** — this is the one place a default-output change is justified, because the
prior default (~30k tokens for `init_db`, worse than grep) was actively harmful. `risk_summary`
keeps totals honest, `truncated` signals the omission, and `limit=0` restores the full set.
`risk_summary` counts the post-`include_tests`-filter, pre-cap set (production-only when
`include_tests=False`), matching the entries actually returned.

### CLI parity — all three impact modes through one handler

`seam impact`'s `--json`, `--quiet`, and default **Rich** modes all route through
`handle_seam_impact` (previously Rich called `impact()` directly and silently ignored `--limit` /
`--lean` — a confirmed parity bug). A shared `_IMPACT_META_KEYS` frozenset is skipped by every
result iterator (quiet output, the total-entry count, Rich rendering) so the new `risk_summary` /
`truncated` dicts are never mistaken for direction groups (the count path would otherwise call
`len()` on an `int`). Rich mode prints a per-direction truncation footer; quiet mode writes a
truncation signal to **stderr** so `stdout` stays a pure bare-name list for pipelines.

## Roadmap P2–P6 — Graph Quality, Resolution & Stable Handles

> Shipped on branch `feat/roadmap-p2-p6`. Schema migrated v7 → v9 (additive). **No new MCP tool
> — count stays 11.** Each feature is gated by a defaulted-on switch; turning the switch off
> restores byte-identical pre-P* behavior.

### P6a — Class inheritance as graph edges (`seam/indexer/graph*.py`)

The dependency graph previously captured only `call` and `import` edges, so a base-class or
interface change had **no upstream blast radius** — its subclasses were invisible to `seam_impact`.
P6a extracts a subclass→base `extends` edge and a class→interface `implements` edge for Python,
TypeScript, Java, and C#. Because the `edges` table is **name-keyed and homonym-collapsed**, every
base/interface reference is normalized to its bare rightmost type name (generic args and
namespace/package qualifiers stripped) by the shared `_base_type_name` helper in `graph_common.py`,
matching how call/import targets are stored. Edges carry `confidence='INFERRED'` (a base name is a
type reference, not a resolved-in-file symbol) and flow through the **existing** impact/trace
traversal unchanged — no new traversal code. Gated by `SEAM_INHERITANCE_EDGES` (`"on"` default).

### P6b — Framework entry-point scoring (`seam/analysis/processes.py`, schema v9)

Raw downstream-reach ranking buries a framework's true entry points: a Flask route or Django view
often delegates to one service call (shallow reach) yet *is* where execution begins. `compute_entry_score(file_path, decorators)` returns a small multiplier (≥1.0, neutral baseline 1.0)
from two cheap, language-agnostic signals — the file **path** pattern (`views.py`, `routes/`,
`controllers/`, `cmd/`, …) and the symbol's **decorator** text (`@app.route`, `@router.get`,
`@GetMapping`, …) — taking the MAX matching multiplier (not a sum). It is **pure and never raises**:
bad input → 1.0.

The score is computed **at index time** in `upsert_file` and persisted to the new
`symbols.entry_score` column (schema v9). At read time, `list_entry_points` ranks by
`entry_score * reach` while still reporting the **raw** `reach` (the multiplier is a ranking signal
only). `_load_entry_scores` mirrors `_load_meta`'s lowest-id-wins homonym-collapse rule, and a NULL
score (pre-v9 / un-reindexed row) is treated as the neutral 1.0. `SEAM_ENTRY_SCORE=off` forces the
baseline for every symbol → byte-identical to raw-reach ranking.

### P3 — tsconfig aliases + go.mod module prefix (`seam/analysis/imports_resolve.py`)

Import promotion (Phase 5) could not resolve two common cross-file forms, leaving them falsely
`AMBIGUOUS`. A new leaf module — split from `imports.py` purely to stay under the 1000-line cap —
adds, all **index/read-time, cached once per `repo_root`, never-raise**:
- **TS/JS path aliases** — `_load_tsconfig_aliases` reads `tsconfig.json` / `jsconfig.json`
  `compilerOptions.paths` + `baseUrl` into a longest-prefix-first map; `_resolve_ts_alias` expands a
  non-relative specifier (`@/foo`) to real files **before** the third-party fallback in
  `resolve_import_source`.
- **Go module prefix** — `_load_go_module` reads the `module <path>` line from `go.mod`; a
  module-qualified import starting with that prefix is stripped to a repo-relative directory and
  resolved normally. Imports outside the prefix (true third-party) still correctly return `[]`.

### P4 — Barrel re-export chasing (`seam/analysis/confidence.py`)

A named import through a barrel (`export { X } from './x'` in an `index.ts`) resolves to the barrel
file, which does **not** declare `X` — so Phase 5's "resolved file must declare the name" guard
correctly refused to promote, but the edge stayed `AMBIGUOUS`. `_resolve_with_import_promotion` now,
when the resolved candidate does not declare the exported name, calls `_chase_barrel`: it follows
that file's **own** `import_mappings` for the name, resolving each re-export source (with a TS/JS
directory→`index.*` fallback in `_resolve_barrel_source`) and recursing until a single declaring
file is found — up to `SEAM_BARREL_DEPTH` (default `3`) hops. **Bounded, cycle-safe** (a `visited`
set of `(file, name)` pairs guards termination and avoids repeat DB hits), and it stops on a
branch to multiple declarers (genuine ambiguity). `SEAM_BARREL_DEPTH=0` disables it entirely.

### P2 — Cluster quality (`seam/indexer/cluster_index.py`, `cluster_naming.py`, schema v8)

Three changes make Louvain communities read as real functional areas:
1. **Confidence-filtered edges (large graphs only).** `_should_filter_edges(symbol_count)` gates on
   `SEAM_CLUSTER_CONFIDENCE_FILTER` (default `1000`): when the graph is large enough that homonym
   `AMBIGUOUS` edges would wrongly merge unrelated modules, only high-trust edges (EXTRACTED, or
   import-kind INFERRED) are passed to `detect_communities`. Small/sparse repos pass the full set
   (those AMBIGUOUS edges are often the only connective tissue). `"off"` never filters; `"0"` always.
2. **Two-level labels.** `_module_dir_for_path` walks a member file's path from leaf upward and
   returns the first **non-generic** directory, skipping packaging scaffolding (`GENERIC_DIRS` =
   `src`/`lib`/`app`/`pkg`/`main`/`core`/`base`) — so `render/src/widget.py` labels as `render`.
3. **Cohesion (schema v8 `clusters.cohesion`).** `_compute_cohesion` = internal-edge / total-edge
   ratio over a deterministic sample (≤50 members per cluster, a perf bound on hub clusters),
   computed from the **full unfiltered** edge graph so the score reflects real connectivity. It
   feeds a deliberately tiny additive search-rank bonus (`seam/query/fts.py`) that only nudges
   ordering among otherwise-equal results.

### P5 — Swift inter-class call resolution (`seam/indexer/graph_swift.py`)

Swift call edges were bare-identifier only. P5 adds **function-scope-local** receiver-type inference
for two high-value member-call patterns, resolved to qualified `Type.method` edges at index time:
`self.method()` → `<EnclosingType>.method`, and `Foo().method()` or a same-scope
`let x = Foo(); x.method()` → `Foo.method` (tracked via a per-function `var→class` dict during the
AST walk — no cross-file inference). `SEAM_SWIFT_TYPE_INFERENCE=off` reverts to bare-identifier
edges. See ADR-009.

### P6c — Stable symbol UID handle (`seam/server/tools.py`, `seam/query/engine.py`)

A homonym follow-up (search → context) otherwise forces an agent to re-disambiguate by file path —
an extra round-trip. `compute_uid(file_path, start_line)` = `sha1(abs_path)[:8] + ':' + line` is a
**pure computed string** surfaced on every `seam_search` / `seam_query` result (computed from the
ABSOLUTE path *before* relativization, so it round-trips). `seam_context` / `seam_impact` /
`seam_trace` accept it as an alternative to the name argument (`uid`, plus `target_uid` on trace).
Resolution (`_resolve_uid`) narrows by `start_line` in SQL — cheap, no schema change, no O(files)
scan — then recomputes the UID over each candidate's absolute path until one matches.
`engine.context_at(file, line)` powers the exact-symbol context path (vs. `context()`'s first-by-
name); the impact/trace graphs are name-keyed, so a UID there is resolved to its symbol NAME. An
unknown/stale UID returns the standard not-found result, never an error.

## Tier D11 — `seam_structure`: Whole-Repository Structure View

> Tier D11 shipped on branch `feat/tier-d11-structure-view`. **No schema change, no migration, no
> new config schema version** — pure read over the existing `symbols` + `files` + `clusters` tables.
> MCP tool count goes from **11 → 12** (`seam_structure` is the 12th tool).

### Why a Physical Structure View Alongside Clusters

Seam already exposes `seam_clusters` (semantic community view), which groups symbols by call/import
coupling. `seam_structure` adds the complementary **physical container map**: the filesystem
hierarchy with symbol counts and cluster area labels per node. The two views answer different
questions:

| View | Primary question | Organisation |
|------|-----------------|--------------|
| `seam_clusters` | "What is logically coupled to X?" | Semantic communities (Louvain) |
| `seam_structure` | "Where does X live? What else is in that file/dir?" | Filesystem hierarchy |

An agent understanding a repo for the first time needs the physical map first; the cluster view
provides a second, semantic cut. Both views share the same cluster `area` label, so a node in the
structure tree annotated `area: "auth"` is the Louvain community a maintainer would recognise.

### New Module: `seam/query/structure.py`

Leaf read module. Single public function:

```python
build_structure(conn, root, *, path=None, max_depth=None, max_nodes=None) -> StructureResult
```

Algorithm:
1. Fetch all `(file_path, name, kind, start_line)` rows in one `JOIN files` query — O(symbols),
   no per-file queries.
2. Partition each file's symbols into containers (class/interface/type), members (method or
   qualified `Owner.member`), and top-level functions. Members roll up into their owning
   container's `members` count — they are NOT emitted as separate tree nodes, keeping the
   skeleton compact.
3. Build the dir → file → container/function tree by navigating path parts, creating dir nodes
   on demand via a `rel_path → StructureNode` dict (O(1) lookup per dir).
4. Annotate each file node with a functional `area` label drawn from the cluster the plurality
   of that file's symbols belong to. Dir nodes inherit the plurality of their direct children's
   areas (bottom-up propagation after tree assembly).
5. Apply Slice 3 bounds (depth cap → node cap), accumulate dropped counts into `truncated`.

Never raises — returns a valid empty tree on any error.

**Node shape:**
```
StructureNode:
  kind:         'dir' | 'file' | 'container' | 'function'
  name:         display name (dir basename, file name, symbol name)
  path:         repo-root-relative string; null for container and function nodes
  symbol_count: total symbols in this subtree (file: row count; dir: sum of children)
  area:         cluster label (null when no cluster data exists)
  children:     child StructureNodes
  members:      method/member count rolled into this container (0 for non-containers)
```

### Depth and Node Caps — Non-Obvious Semantics

**`depth` counts ALL tree levels, not only directory nesting.** Root is depth 0; its immediate
children are depth 1; a file directly under root is depth 1; its containers are depth 2. In
practice a codebase with two directory levels, files, and containers occupies depths 0–4. The
default `SEAM_STRUCTURE_MAX_DEPTH=8` is deliberately generous so containers survive for typical
repo layouts (3–5 dirs + 1 file level + 1 container level = 5–7 total). Maintainers who set a
small `--depth` (e.g. `--depth 2`) should expect containers to be truncated even for top-level
files, because file→container occupies depth 2 from root.

**`SEAM_STRUCTURE_MAX_NODES <= 0` means UNLIMITED** — matching the `seam_impact limit=0`
convention used throughout Seam. Setting `--nodes 0` or `SEAM_STRUCTURE_MAX_NODES=0` disables
the node cap entirely (the full tree is returned). A negative value has the same effect; the
guard in `_apply_node_cap` is `if max_nodes <= 0: return 0`. This avoids the footgun where an
operator setting the knob to `-1` or `0` silently receives an empty tree instead of an
uncapped one.

**BFS drop order (node cap):** when the node cap is reached, the algorithm drops *all* children of
the current node together rather than including partial sibling groups. Including 3 of 5 containers
in a file would imply the file has fewer symbols than it does. The whole-group drop keeps
`symbol_count` and `members` values honest on surviving nodes.

### New 12th MCP Tool: `seam_structure`

Registered in `seam/server/mcp.py`. Parameters:

| Param | Type | Default | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|---------|
| `path` | `str \| null` | `null` | Scope to a subdirectory (relative resolves against repo root, not server cwd) |
| `depth` | `int \| null` | `SEAM_STRUCTURE_MAX_DEPTH` (8) | Max tree depth (counts dir+file+container levels — see note above) |
| `nodes` | `int \| null` | `SEAM_STRUCTURE_MAX_NODES` (2000) | Max non-root nodes; 0 = unlimited |

Returns `{found: false}` when the tree has no symbols (empty index, or scope matches nothing).
All file paths in the response are root-relative; container nodes carry `path: null`.

### New CLI Command: `seam structure`

```bash
seam structure                        # Rich tree with branch glyphs (default)
seam structure --json                 # JSON envelope {"ok":true,"data":{tree,truncated}}
seam structure --quiet                # plain indented text (one node per line)
seam structure /path/to/repo          # inspect a specific project
seam structure --scope src/           # scope to the src/ subdirectory
seam structure --depth 3              # max depth 3 (note: includes file+container levels)
```

Implemented in `seam/cli/main.py` with two render helpers: `_render_structure_quiet` (plain text
for piping) and `_render_structure_rich` (branch glyphs + colour, mirroring `seam flows`). Both
helpers show the `area` label on dir and file nodes when present.

### System Diagram Update (Tier D11)

The MCP server section now has a 12th tool:

```
                         ├── seam_structure(path?, depth?, nodes?)
                         │           → query.structure.build_structure()
                                   [Tier D11]
```

### Config Knobs (Tier D11)

| Knob | Default | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `SEAM_STRUCTURE_MAX_DEPTH` | `8` | Max tree depth (counts dir+file+container levels, not dirs only) |
| `SEAM_STRUCTURE_MAX_NODES` | `2000` | Max non-root nodes; `<= 0` = unlimited |

## Composition ("holds") Edges

> Shipped on branch `feat/composition-holds-edges`. **No schema migration** — `"holds"` is a new
> value in the existing `edges.kind TEXT` column, not a new column or table. No read-path or
> traversal code was changed. MCP tool count stays 12.

### What "holds" captures

A `holds` edge records **class composition**: a class or struct that stores a typed user-defined
value as a named field/property, or receives one as a typed constructor/init parameter, emits:

```
Edge(source=OwningClass, target=HeldType, kind="holds", confidence="INFERRED")
```

Examples that produce a `holds` edge:
- Python `self.client: Client = client` (typed field assignment)
- TypeScript `private db: Database` (typed property declaration)
- Go `type Server struct { store Store }` (typed struct field)
- Java `private final UserRepo repo;` (typed class field)
- Swift `var engine: Engine` (stored property declaration)

Examples that do NOT produce a `holds` edge:
- Method parameter types (transient; not stored composition)
- Local variable type annotations (not stored on the class)
- Return types
- Optional/container/generic wrappers (`Client | None`, `list[Client]`, `Array<Client>`)
- Primitive types and builtins (`int`, `string`, `bool`, filtered via `is_builtin()`)
- Dotted-qualified type names (conservative: cross-package names not resolved)

### Why this is useful

Before composition edges, `seam_impact` on a data-model class showed only call-graph reach:
"who calls methods of this class?" Composition adds the structural dimension: "who *is* this
class, structurally?" — i.e., which owning classes embed it as a stored field. Changing the
constructor signature or field layout of `Client` now surfaces `Server` (which holds a `Client`)
in the blast radius at d=1, not just callers of `Client.send`.

### Per-family collector design

Composition scanning reuses the existing class-level pre-scans in the inference leaf modules —
the same AST pass that builds the `var_types` dict for receiver-type inference also collects
stored field/property types. No new AST traversal is added.

| Leaf module | Languages | AST nodes scanned |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| `graph_scope_infer.py` | Python, TypeScript/JS | class body attribute defs, property declarations |
| `graph_scope_infer_ext.py` | Go, Rust | struct field declarations |
| `graph_scope_infer_ext2.py` | Java, C#, C++, Ruby, PHP | field/member declarations |
| `graph_swift_infer.py` | Swift | stored property declarations |

Each collector returns `list[tuple[str, str]]` — `(field_name, type_name)` pairs. The extractor
in the parent `graph_*.py` module converts each pair into a `holds` edge, applying the
conservatism contract before emitting.

### Conservatism contract

`holds` edges apply the **same conservatism rules** as receiver-type inference (Tier B):

- **Plain user type only**: `resolve_plain_type(type_text) → str | None` strips whitespace and
  returns `None` for optionals (`X | None`, `X?`, `Optional[X]`), containers (`list[X]`,
  `dict[K,V]`, `[X]`), generics (`Array<X>`, `Set<X>`), and dotted qualified names (`pkg.Type`).
- **Builtin filter**: `is_builtin(type_name, language)` gates emission — no `Class holds int`
  or `Class holds string` noise enters the graph.
- **INFERRED confidence**: composition is a structural reference, not a resolved-import link.
  `holds` edges always carry `confidence="INFERRED"`. This mirrors `extends`/`implements` edges
  (P6a) which also express structural relationships at INFERRED confidence.
- **Never raises**: any extraction failure silently returns an empty list; the extractor skips
  gracefully (same contract as all parsers in the pipeline).

### Traversal — automatic, no new code

The traversal layer (`seam/analysis/traversal.py`) is **kind-agnostic**: it walks all edges
regardless of `kind`. Adding `"holds"` to `edges.kind` therefore flows through `seam_impact`,
`seam_context`, and `seam_trace` automatically — if you change `HeldType`, `OwningClass`
appears upstream at d=1 with no traversal code changes.

### Config knob

`SEAM_COMPOSITION_EDGES: "on" | "off"` (default `"on"`) — master switch for composition-edge
emission at extraction time. Set to `"off"` to suppress all `holds` edges; byte-identical to
pre-composition behaviour. Like all other extraction-time knobs (`SEAM_TYPE_INFERENCE`,
`SEAM_INHERITANCE_EDGES`), toggling takes effect only on the next `seam init` re-index —
the existing stored edges are not retroactively removed.

---

## A3 — Field-Access Edges (`reads` / `writes`) + Field Symbols

> Shipped on branch `feat/field-access-edges`. **No schema migration** — `"reads"`, `"writes"`,
> and `"field"` are new values in the existing `edges.kind TEXT` and `symbols.kind TEXT` columns.
> Extraction-time, per-file, watcher-compatible. MCP tool count stays 12.
> `seam_context` gains `field_readers` and `field_writers` in its output.

### The visibility gap A3 closes

Before A3, the call graph captured invocations but not data-flow through stored fields. A field
read (`obj.url`) or write (`obj.url = x`) had no edge — so renaming `Config.url` or changing
its type produced zero upstream results from `seam_impact`. A3 adds per-access-site edges that
make field data-flow as visible as method control-flow.

### New edge kinds: `reads` and `writes`

Edge kind vocabulary grows from 6 to **8**:

```
call | import | extends | implements | instantiates | holds | reads | writes
```

| Kind | When emitted | Mode detection |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| `reads` | `obj.field` appears as an expression rvalue | Default — any non-write access |
| `writes` | `obj.field = x`, `obj.field += x`, `del obj.field` | LHS of assignment, augmented-assign, or `del` |

All field-access edges carry `confidence='INFERRED'`. The edge `source` is the enclosing symbol
(function/method); the `target` is the field name (bare or `Type.field` when the receiver type is
inferred).

### Fields/properties as first-class symbols

`symbols.kind` gains `'field'`. A class field/property is now indexed as:

```
Symbol(name='Client.url', kind='field', qualified_name='Client.url', ...)
```

This is additive — no migration needed, no column added. Field symbols participate in FTS5 search,
`seam_context`, and `seam_impact` exactly like method symbols. Existing tooling that treats `kind`
as a closed enum must be updated to handle `'field'`.

### Conservatism contract (same as Tier B)

Receiver type resolution follows the same two-layer scope model as `resolve_receiver_type`:

1. `self`/`this`/`cls` → resolved to the enclosing class → qualified `Type.field` edge emitted
2. Typed local/param receiver (via `resolve_receiver_type`) → `Type.field` when confidently inferred
3. Unresolvable receiver → bare `field` name kept (never emit a wrong edge)

Optionals, containers, generics, chained receivers, and unknown identifiers return `None` →
edge silently omitted (false negative always preferred over false positive).

### New read-path view: `field_readers` / `field_writers`

`seam/query/context.py` adds two lists to the context result:

- `field_readers` — symbols that have a `reads` edge pointing to this symbol
- `field_writers` — symbols that have a `writes` edge pointing to this symbol

These are the **typed** complement to `callers`, which remains the inclusive BFS view (all edge
kinds). Use `field_readers`/`field_writers` to distinguish data-flow from control-flow precisely;
use `callers` for the full inclusive blast radius.

### Write-path data flow (seam init, per file)

```
For each source file (same pass as call-edge extraction):
  a. field_access.extract_field_access_edges(node, language, path, symbols)
     → dispatches to per-family leaf module
     → per access site: detect mode (reads / writes) from AST context
     → resolve receiver type (self→class / typed receiver / bare)
     → emit Edge(source=enclosing_fn, target=field_name, kind='reads'|'writes',
                 confidence='INFERRED', receiver=raw_text)
  b. db.upsert_file writes edges alongside call/holds edges
  c. field symbols (kind='field') written to symbols table in the same upsert
```

Because this runs per-file in the existing pipeline, the **watcher picks up field-access edges
automatically** — no post-pass needed (unlike synthesis or clustering).

### Module split (1000-line cap)

| Leaf module | Languages |
|-------------|-----------|
| `seam/indexer/field_access.py` | Python extractor + facade re-exports |
| `seam/indexer/field_access_ts.py` | TypeScript / JavaScript |
| `seam/indexer/field_access_go_rust.py` | Go / Rust |
| `seam/indexer/field_access_ext.py` | Java / C# |
| `seam/indexer/field_access_c_cpp.py` | C / C++ |
| `seam/indexer/field_access_ext2.py` | Ruby / PHP |
| `seam/indexer/field_access_php_swift.py` | PHP emission helpers + Swift |

### Traversal — automatic, no new code

The traversal layer (`seam/analysis/traversal.py`) is **kind-agnostic**: it walks all edges
regardless of `kind`. Adding `reads`/`writes` flows through `seam_impact`, `seam_context`,
and `seam_trace` automatically — exactly the same mechanism as `holds` and synthesized edges.

### Config knob

`SEAM_FIELD_ACCESS_EDGES: "on" | "off"` (default `"on"`) — master switch for field-access-edge
emission and field-symbol extraction at extraction time. Set to `"off"` for byte-identical
pre-A3 behavior (no `reads`/`writes` edges, no `kind='field'` symbols). Like all extraction-time
knobs, toggling takes effect only on the next `seam init` re-index.
